# How to Setup Scrum for Tech Docs

As a technical writing manager, I've found that using a combination of Agile and Scrum has significantly improved both productivity and collaboration. If you’re not familiar with Scrum, it’s a structured framework that allows you to break down complex documentation projects into manageable sprints, prioritize tasks, so you can adapt quickly to changes. Let’s say the scope of work now includes API Reference documentation that wasn’t part of the initial information development plan.&#x20;

Interested in getting started?

1. Form a cross-functional team
2. Define roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Team Members)
3. Create a documentation backlog
4. Plan sprint durations (typically 1-4 weeks)
5. Establish sprint planning meetings
6. Implement daily stand-ups
7. Set up sprint review and retrospective meetings
8. Choose Scrum tools for task management (Jira, Notion, Trello all work)
9. Define the documentation’s Definition of Done (DoD)
10. Create templates for user stories specific to documentation tasks&#x20;

Next Steps&#x20;

If you're looking to implement Scrum for your tech pubs process, I recommend starting with a discussion with your team and management. Focus this initial conversation on the potential benefits of Scrum for your documentation projects and work on getting buy-in from stakeholders. Run a pilot project to demonstrate how it could work. Once there's agreement to proceed, form the Scrum structure, define roles with your team, and use burn down/up charts to demonstrate your progress. Make sense? Let me know how you get on.
