# How to Apply Agile for Technical Documentation

While Agile is mostly used in the context of software development, you can also apply an Agile mindset to your documentation lifecycle. This works well if your tech doc deliverables are written in sync with the product release.

What I’ve seen is that by adopting Agile practices in technical writing you get more flexible, responsive, and user-focused documentation. It allows technical writers to iterate quickly, incorporate feedback efficiently, and align more closely with product development cycles.

For instance, a fast-paced startup implementing new features could benefit from Agile documentation by releasing incremental updates to user guides in sync with each sprint, ensuring that documentation always reflects the latest product version.

This method particularly benefits cross-functional teams, users, and organizations striving for continuous improvement in their documentation quality and relevance.

Interested in running a prototype to see if it could work?

### Checklist

Here's a checklist to get started with implementing Agile technical documentation:

1. Align documentation sprints with development sprints
2. Create a documentation backlog and prioritize tasks
3. Implement daily stand-ups (DSUs) for the documentation team
4. Use collaborative tools for version control and review
5. Establish a system to gather and incorporate user feedback
6. Define clear acceptance criteria for documentation tasks
7. Conduct regular retrospectives to improve processes
8. Implement continuous integration for documentation builds, e.g. Git ([CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/))
9. Use Agile estimation techniques for documentation tasks. From what I’ve seen, story points work best. &#x20;
10. Set up a system to measure and track documentation quality and impact

### &#x20;Next Steps

To see if Agile is a good fit for your technical documentation team, begin by assessing your current documentation workflow and identifying areas where Agile could bring improvements.

Talk to the development team to understand their sprint structure and how documentation can be integrated.

Start small by implementing one or two Agile practices, such as creating a documentation backlog or holding daily stand-ups. Gradually introduce more elements as your team becomes comfortable with the Agile mindset. Remember, the key is to remain flexible and continuously refine your approach based on what works best for your team and your users.

Let me know how you get on or if you have any questions about adopting an Agile framework.
