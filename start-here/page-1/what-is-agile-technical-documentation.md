# What is Agile Technical Documentation?

Key aspects include:

* Iterative development: Documentation is created and updated incrementally alongside software iterations.&#x20;
* Just-in-time documentation: Focus on creating only necessary documents when they're needed.
* Collaboration: Writers work closely with developers, testers, and other team members.&#x20;
* Flexibility: Documentation adapts to changes in software requirements and features.&#x20;
* User-centric: Emphasis on creating content that directly addresses user needs.&#x20;
* Continuous documents: Provide continuous updates and improvements to keep documentation set current.&#x20;
* Lightweight processes: Focus on simplicity and effectiveness, reducing unnecessary overhead to provide valuable, relevant customer-centric documentation.

### Difference Between Agile and Waterfall approaches

Agile technical documentation differs from traditional Waterfall documentation approaches in several key ways:

**1. Timing**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Created incrementally throughout development

&#x20;  \- Traditional: Often created at the end or in large batches

**2. Scope**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Focuses on essential information

&#x20;  \- Traditional: Tends to be comprehensive, sometimes including unused details

**3. Flexibility**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Easily adaptable to changes

&#x20;  \- Traditional: More rigid, harder to update

**4. Integration with development**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Closely integrated with the development process

&#x20;  \- Traditional: Often separate from development

**5. Audience focus**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Prioritizes immediate user needs

&#x20;  \- Traditional: May include information for various stakeholders

**6. Collaboration**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Writers work closely with developers and other team members

&#x20;  \- Traditional: Sometimes created by dedicated technical writers in isolation

**7. Tools**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Often uses the same tools as developers (e.g., Jira can be used to create draft release notes)

&#x20;  \- Traditional: May use specialized documentation tools

**8. Review process**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Continuous review and updates

&#x20;  \- Traditional: Often has formal, lengthy review cycles

**9. Release cycle**

&#x20;  \- Agile: Frequent, small updates

&#x20;  \- Traditional: Large, infrequent releases
