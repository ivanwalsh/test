# Agile Technical Documentation

Are you seeking an experienced technical writing manager who can modernize your documentation processes? With a proven track record in leadership and change management, I bring expertise in:

* Technical writing and content strategy&#x20;
* Document lifecycle management
* Efficient production and delivery systems&#x20;
* Team development and recruitment&#x20;
* Implement modern documentation technologies and methodologies, such as Agile.

I can guide your team through transitions, optimize workflows, and deliver high-quality technical content that meets both user needs and business objectives.

Agile documentation allows you to create and maintain complex technical documentation based on the principles of Agile software development. In Agile, the focus is to deliver software quickly and iteratively, with an emphasis on flexibility and collaboration.
